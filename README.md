1-How does the execution time change when problem size is increased? Report it by running the same algorithm for the given datasets.
Answer: I did not report because the data set was not given. However, since the complexity of the problem we solve and the code we write is in polynomial time, execution time also increases as polynomial as the size of the problem increases.

The part that is written by me:
